# Invisible-Cloak
Invisible Cloak using OpenCV — A fun computer vision project inspired by Harry Potter! This Python script detects a cloak color in real-time video using HSV color space, creates a mask with morphological operations, and replaces it with the static background, making the wearer appear invisible.
